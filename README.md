<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Your top management have decided to market a new solution called "Visitors Pass": This Web Application will allow the company executives to administer visits and visitors, 
user rights, other amenities like visitor's history, generated Badges. It will also keep a track of the whereabouts of each visitor and host throughout the day
and accordingly, record the details in a corporate file. This Visitor Management Software also manages to print an identity
badge for a visitor to enter the premises, thus, reducing the receptionist's workload because Visitlog will manage to track every visitor's record, virtually. 
It will also automatically create the list of the current number of visitors in the company for the emergency, if arises any. There are 3 categories of users in the app, 
an administrator, an employee, and a receptionist.

* As an employee:
When you want to visit an employee of the company, the latter must
create a new visit in the application by specifying the following
information: the nature of the visit, the date and time of arrival, time
of end of visit, Company or individual, if company, enter the name of
the company, the name, email, and phone number of the person
concerned, the persons accompanied (Text area), a photo (optional,
if not a default picture).
After having validated all the information of the visit, the user can
then print the badge in PDF format containing all the information
related to the visit.

* As an administrator:
in the home page of administrators, there is a dashboard which allows
you to display some statistics on visits: Number of visits, number of
visitors today, number of visitors the current month. The
administrator can manage user accounts (CRUD), List of visits.

* As a receptionist
The application shows all visits for the current day.
